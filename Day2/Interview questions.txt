Interview Questions

1. Explain Built in methods?
    Built-in functions in Python are pre-defined functions that are readily available for use without requiring any explicit import statements. 
    These functions are part of the core Python language and provide common functionalities, simplifying various programming tasks.

2. How to check data type of variable?
    In Python, the data type of a variable can be determined using built-in type() function.
    for example :- a = 10
                   print(type(a)) #<class int>

3. How to get memory address of a variable?
    In Python, you can obtain a unique identifier for an object, which effectively represents its memory address, using the built-in id() function. 
    This function returns an integer that is guaranteed to be unique for the lifetime of the object.

4. Explain Operator and its type?
    Operators in Python are special symbols or keywords that perform operations on one or more values or variables, known as operands. 
    They are fundamental building blocks for writing expressions and manipulating data.
    Types :-
            Arithmetic Operators(+, -, *, /, %, //, **)
            comparison Operators(==, !=, >, <, >=, <=)
            Assignment Operators(=, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=, //=, **=)
            Logical Operators(and, or, not)
            MEmbership Operators(in, not in)
            Identity Operators(is, is not)
            Bitwise Operators()

5. Explain arithmetic Operator with example
    - Arithmetic operators in Python are used to perform mathematical operations on numeric values. 
        Here are the main arithmetic operators with examples:
        
        #addition
        a = 5
        b = 3
        print(a + b)  # Output: 8

        # Subtraction
        print(a - b)  # Output: 2

        # Multiplication
        print(a * b)  # Output: 15

        # Division
        print(a / b)  # Output: 1.666...

        # Modulus (remainder)
        print(a % b)  # Output: 2

        # Floor Division (quotient without remainder)
        print(a // b) # Output: 1

        # Exponentiation
        print(a ** b) # Output: 125

6. What are identifiers & variable?

    Identifiers:
    - Identifiers are names used to identify variables, functions, classes, modules, and other objects in Python. 
    - They must start with a letter (a-z, A-Z) or an underscore (_), followed by letters, digits (0-9), or underscores. 
    - Identifiers are case-sensitive.

    Variable:
    -A variable is an identifier that is used to store data values. The value assigned to a variable can change during program execution. 
    For example:
        name = "Alice"
        age = 25
    Here, 'name' and 'age' are variables (identifiers) storing a string and an integer value, respectively.
